### manopt
subspace identification requires manopt to perform manifold optimization. Install manopt and place root directory here.

### optFunctions
optimization functions

### subspace_opt scripts
These scripts perform subspace identification and various analyses.

* subspace_opt: performs subspace identification using full population activity.

* subspace_opt_pca: performs subspace identification using PCA-reduced population activity

* subspace_opt_ptcells: performs subspace identification with full population activity combined with PT Lower and PT Upper tagged cells. 

* subspace_opt_ptcells_pca: performs subspace identification with reduced population activity combined with reduced PT Lower and reduced PT Upper tagged cells.
